### Bronze Job Success (Glue ETL)

![Glue Job Success Screenshot](screenshots/glue_job_success.png)

This screenshot shows the successful execution of the bronze-etl-incremental Glue job, which loads only new raw events from S3 using event_timestamp as a watermark, enriches them with metadata and hashes, and appends them to the Bronze layer in compressed Parquet format.

The pipeline includes:

- Incremental load filtering

- AI metadata enrichment (model_input_flag, feature_hash, inference_ts)

- Efficient append strategy (no overwrite)

Resulting files are queryable from Athena and partitioned for downstream performance. 

It confirms the job ran with **2 DPUs** on **AWS Glue 5.0** and completed in **under 2 minutes**.

### Glue Data Catalog: Registered Bronze Table

![Glue Data Catalog Screenshot](screenshots/glue_catalog_bronze_table.png)

Shows the successfully registered `bronze_user_events_parquet` table in the `ai_lakehouse_db` database.  

This table references the Parquet files written by the AWS Glue job and is now **queryable in Athena** for downstream AI analytics.


### Bronze Layer Output (Parquet Format)

![S3 Bronze Output](screenshots/s3_bronze_parquet_output.png)

This screenshot shows enriched event data successfully written by the Glue ETL job to the  
`s3://ai-lakehouse-project/bronze/user_events_parquet/` S3 folder in partitioned **Parquet format**. 

Output from the incremental Bronze ETL job. Each file represents new enriched JSON converted to Parquet.

The naming format (part-00000...snappy.parquet) confirms Spark-optimized compression.

Timestamps confirm the files are fresh and reflect schema-enriched, AI-ready ingestion,  
suitable for downstream querying via **Athena** or **Redshift Spectrum**.

## 🕷️ Crawler Registration & Glue Catalog Integration

To make each data layer (Bronze, Silver, Gold) queryable in Athena, AWS Glue Crawlers are used to register their respective S3 locations. Crawlers automatically detect schema and update the **Glue Data Catalog**, enabling SQL-based exploration with Athena or Redshift Spectrum.

### Crawler Dashboard Overview

![Crawler Summary](screenshots/glue_crawlers_summary.png)  
All crawlers registered and ran successfully:

- `crawler_bronze_user_events`
- `crawler_silver_user_events`
- `crawler_gold_user_features`

**Completed all 3 crawler registrations (Bronze, Silver, Gold) with table sync confirmed in AWS Glue Catalog.**



### Crawler Setup Summary

| Layer   | Crawler Name                  | Target S3 Path                                                   | Table Name                      | Database           |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|
| Bronze  | `crawler_bronze_user_events`  | `s3://ai-lakehouse-project/bronze/user_events_parquet/`          | `bronze_user_events_parquet`    | `ai_lakehouse_db`  |
| Silver  | `crawler_silver_user_events`  | `s3://ai-lakehouse-project/silver/user_events/`                  | `silver_user_events`            | `ai_lakehouse_db`  |
| Gold    | `crawler_gold_user_features`  | `s3://ai-lakehouse-project/gold/user_features/`                  | `gold_user_features`            | `ai_lakehouse_db`  |

### How to Configure a Crawler

1. Open **AWS Glue → Crawlers → Add Crawler**
2. Select **S3** as the source and input the appropriate path
3. Choose an IAM role (e.g., `AWSGlueServiceRole_ai_lakehouse`)
4. Set the **target database** to `ai_lakehouse_db`
5. Optionally use a **table prefix** (`bronze_`, `silver_`, `gold_`)
6. Run the crawler to scan the data and create or update the table

Once created, these crawlers keep your Athena metadata **fresh and aligned** with the outputs of your Glue jobs.


* * * * *

Sample Athena Query
----------------------

### 🔹 Bronze Layer Query

```
SELECT
  user_id,
  event_type,
  ingestion_ts,
  model_input_flag,
  inference_ts,
  feature_hash
FROM ai_lakehouse_db.bronze_user_events_parquet
WHERE model_input_flag = true
LIMIT 10;
```
- Filters for ML-ready records with model_input_flag = true
- Queries raw enriched data before deduplication or partitioning

### 🔹 Silver Layer Query (Partition-Aware)

```
SELECT *
FROM ai_lakehouse_db.silver_user_events
WHERE event_type = 'click'
  AND event_date = DATE '2025-06-17';
  ```

- Partition-filtered query for high performance
- Demonstrates Silver layer’s readiness for analytics or model ingestion
- Scans minimal data (0.18 KB) in Athena with sub-second response time

* * * * *
### Challenge: Delta Lake Compatibility in AWS Glue

One of the most frustrating roadblocks I faced was trying to use **Delta Lake** as the storage format in AWS Glue for the Bronze layer.

Despite following official guidance --- including setting Glue job parameters like:

```
--additional-python-modules delta-spark==<version>\
--conf spark.sql.extensions=io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension\
--conf spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog
```

I consistently ran into cryptic path resolution errors, such as:

`IllegalArgumentException: Can not create a Path from an empty  string  `

### How I Resolved It

After testing multiple variations --- including:

-   Upgrading Glue version (4.0 → 5.0)

-   Adjusting Spark and Delta configurations

-   Trying both interactive and job modes

I concluded that **Delta Lake support in Glue is not fully production-ready** without extensive custom setup (e.g., bootstrap scripts, additional JARs).

So instead, I made a **pragmatic pivot**:

-   Switched to **Parquet**, which is natively supported in AWS Glue

-   Preserved schema evolution via Glue Catalog

-   Ensured **Athena queryability** remained intact

* * * * *

### Outcome

Choosing Parquet over Delta allowed me to:

-   Keep momentum on pipeline development

-   Maintain a performant, partitioned data lake

-   Preserve schema traceability via crawlers + Glue Catalog
