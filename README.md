### Bronze Job Success (Glue ETL)

![Glue Job Success Screenshot](screenshots/glue_job_success.png)

This screenshot shows the successful execution of the `bronze_job_parquet` ETL job, which ingests and enriches raw JSON from S3 and writes AI-ready data to the bronze layer in Parquet format.  

It confirms the job ran with **2 DPUs** on **AWS Glue 5.0** and completed in **under 2 minutes**.

### Glue Data Catalog: Registered Bronze Table

![Glue Data Catalog Screenshot](screenshots/glue_catalog_bronze_table.png)

Shows the successfully registered `bronze_user_events_parquet` table in the `ai_lakehouse_db` database.  

This table references the Parquet files written by the AWS Glue job and is now **queryable in Athena** for downstream AI analytics.


### Bronze Layer Output (Parquet Format)

![S3 Bronze Output](screenshots/s3_bronze_parquet_output.png)

This screenshot shows enriched event data successfully written by the Glue ETL job to the  
`s3://ai-lakehouse-project/bronze/user_events_parquet/` S3 folder in partitioned **Parquet format**.  

Timestamps confirm the files are fresh and reflect schema-enriched, AI-ready ingestion,  
suitable for downstream querying via **Athena** or **Redshift Spectrum**.

### Silver Layer ETL Job Success

![Glue Silver Job Success](screenshots/glue_silver_job_success.png)

This screenshot shows the successful execution of the `silver_job_parquet.py` AWS Glue job,  
which reads enriched Bronze-layer Parquet data and writes a **validated, deduplicated, partitioned** Silver-layer dataset.

The job ran on **2 DPUs using AWS Glue 5.0**, completed in under 2 minutes, and wrote to:  
`s3://ai-lakehouse-project/silver/user_events/`

This Silver ETL layer prepares data for **fast, partition-aware Athena queries**,  
as well as **AI model training pipelines** and downstream **feature engineering workflows**.


### Silver Layer Output (Partitioned Parquet Format)

![S3 Silver Output](screenshots/s3_silver_output.png)

This screenshot shows validated and deduplicated Silver-layer data written to  
`s3://ai-lakehouse-project/silver/user_events/` by the `silver_job_parquet.py` Glue job.  

The output is organized using a **two-level partitioning scheme**:  
- `event_type` (e.g., `click`, `purchase`)  
- `event_date` (extracted from timestamp)

This structure improves **Athena query performance**, lowers **scan costs**,  
and sets the foundation for scalable **feature engineering** or **ML ingestion workflows**.



## Gold Layer Output & Validation

### Gold ETL Job Success

![Gold Glue Job](screenshots/glue_gold_job_success.png)  
The final AWS Glue job successfully processed the Silver data into aggregated **user-level features**, writing to the Gold layer in Parquet format.

This job used **2 DPUs on Glue 5.0**, completed in under 2 minutes, and demonstrates schema evolution and partitioned output.

### Gold Output in S3

![S3 Gold Output](screenshots/s3_gold_output.png)  
Data was written to:



### Athena Query Success: Bronze Layer Output

![Athena Query Result](screenshots/athena_query_parquet_success1.png)


This Athena query validates that the `bronze_user_events_parquet` table is registered and queryable.  
It filters for records marked as `model_input_flag = true` and selects AI-relevant fields such as  
`user_id`, `event_type`, and `feature_hash`.

The query succeeded in under 2 seconds, demonstrating low-latency access to enriched event data  
in Parquet format — optimized for downstream **AI analytics** and **feature engineering**.


### Athena Query: Silver Layer (Partitioned Read)

![Athena Silver Query](screenshots/athena_silver_query1.png)

This screenshot shows a successful Athena query against the `silver_user_events` table.  
The query filters by partition columns `event_type` and `event_date`, demonstrating optimized access to Parquet data.

Query returned a record with:
- `user_id = u001`
- `event_type = click`
- `event_timestamp = 2025-06-17T14:05:00Z`

With **run time under 1 second** and **only 0.18 KB scanned**, this confirms that the Silver layer is:
- Queryable
- Partitioned effectively
- Ready for analytics and ML pipelines

### Athena Query – Gold Layer

![Athena Gold Query](screenshots/athena_gold_query.png)  
This Athena query shows:

- User-level aggregation from the Gold table
- Click and purchase counts
- Min/max timestamps per user

The query succeeded with sub-second latency — demonstrating partition efficiency and production readiness.

## 🕷️ Crawler Registration & Glue Catalog Integration

To make each data layer (Bronze, Silver, Gold) queryable in Athena, AWS Glue Crawlers are used to register their respective S3 locations. Crawlers automatically detect schema and update the **Glue Data Catalog**, enabling SQL-based exploration with Athena or Redshift Spectrum.

### Crawler Dashboard Overview

![Crawler Summary](screenshots/glue_crawlers_summary.png)  
All crawlers registered and ran successfully:

- `crawler_bronze_user_events`
- `crawler_silver_user_events`
- `crawler_gold_user_features`

**Completed all 3 crawler registrations (Bronze, Silver, Gold) with table sync confirmed in AWS Glue Catalog.**



### Crawler Setup Summary

| Layer   | Crawler Name                  | Target S3 Path                                                   | Table Name                      | Database           |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|
| Bronze  | `crawler_bronze_user_events`  | `s3://ai-lakehouse-project/bronze/user_events_parquet/`          | `bronze_user_events_parquet`    | `ai_lakehouse_db`  |
| Silver  | `crawler_silver_user_events`  | `s3://ai-lakehouse-project/silver/user_events/`                  | `silver_user_events`            | `ai_lakehouse_db`  |
| Gold    | `crawler_gold_user_features`  | `s3://ai-lakehouse-project/gold/user_features/`                  | `gold_user_features`            | `ai_lakehouse_db`  |

### How to Configure a Crawler

1. Open **AWS Glue → Crawlers → Add Crawler**
2. Select **S3** as the source and input the appropriate path
3. Choose an IAM role (e.g., `AWSGlueServiceRole_ai_lakehouse`)
4. Set the **target database** to `ai_lakehouse_db`
5. Optionally use a **table prefix** (`bronze_`, `silver_`, `gold_`)
6. Run the crawler to scan the data and create or update the table

Once created, these crawlers keep your Athena metadata **fresh and aligned** with the outputs of your Glue jobs.

Sample Athena Query
----------------------

### 🔹 Bronze Layer Query

```
SELECT
  user_id,
  event_type,
  ingestion_ts,
  model_input_flag,
  inference_ts,
  feature_hash
FROM ai_lakehouse_db.bronze_user_events_parquet
WHERE model_input_flag = true
LIMIT 10;
```
- Filters for ML-ready records with model_input_flag = true
- Queries raw enriched data before deduplication or partitioning

### 🔹 Silver Layer Query (Partition-Aware)

```
SELECT *
FROM ai_lakehouse_db.silver_user_events
WHERE event_type = 'click'
  AND event_date = DATE '2025-06-17';
  ```

- Partition-filtered query for high performance
- Demonstrates Silver layer’s readiness for analytics or model ingestion
- Scans minimal data (0.18 KB) in Athena with sub-second response time

### Challenge & Resolution: Delta Lake Compatibility in AWS Glue

One of the most frustrating challenges I encountered was trying to use Delta Lake format in AWS Glue for my Bronze layer. 

Despite following the official documentation and configuring the necessary job parameters (e.g., `--additional-python-modules`, Delta extensions), I kept running into persistent path resolution errors like `IllegalArgumentException: Can not create a Path from an empty string`."**

#### How I Overcame It

After trying over a dozen variations, including Spark config changes and Glue version upgrades, I realized that full Delta Lake support wasn't production-ready in Glue without a complex setup.

Rather than lose momentum, I pivoted to using **Parquet** --- a fully supported format --- and ensured schema evolution, catalog registration, and Athena queryability still worked end-to-end.


This let me move forward with building the rest of the pipeline while still following best practices for analytical data formats.

#### What I Learned

I learned to **balance ideal tech with practical delivery**. I now test compatibility early and prioritize **progress over perfection** when deadlines matter --- a mindset that serves me well in real-world data engineering work.
